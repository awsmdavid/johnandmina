                  Amy works as a news producer for CBS in Richmond (she was also the cute Asian news reporter in Charlottesville on NBC29!). Amy and I met in middle school on picture day! Amy is not only one of the most active people I know, but she has a charismatic and loving personality as well. I was lucky to not only go to middle school/high school with her, but to also have gone to UVA with Amy! Throughout the past ten years, we have accumulated so many memories (slumber parties, amusement parks, vineyards, happy hours…), that I will always cherish. I know that at the end of the day, I can always count on this girl. Great minds think alike! ;)

                  Kristie works for DC Public Schools and acts as a consultant for local elementary schools. She

and I are cousins, and basically grew up together! We used to do things like put on orchestra 

concerts for our family (we may have solicited money in the process :P), cover each other in 

beanie babies, and choreograph dances to Backstreet Boys' songs. So basically, we were (and 

are) super cool, and not at all nerdy. It's still hard to believe that we are all grown-up now! To 

this day, Kristie is one of the most caring/protective people I know (she used to protect my 

younger brother from bully me back in the day...) and is also one of the best calligraphists/hand-

letterers too!

                  <div class="party-subtext">Lynn Teng</div>
                  Lynn currently works for an architecture firm in Jakarta, Indonesia. I first met Lynn my first year 

in college at a bus stop, of all places! I remember talking to her a little bit on the bus after that, 

but we lost touch until our third year of college. We are so silly together, but at the end of the 

day, Lynn is one of those people that I can always talk to- I definitely value her wisdom and 

godly advice. And regardless of where we are or what we do (like getting lost in the middle of 

nowhere) we always have so much fun together! (This may or may not have actually 

happened...). I'm sad that we are now halfway across the world for each other, but thankful for 

our strong friendship despite the distance!

                  Sophie has taken the med-school track, and is now starting rotations! I actually met Sophie in 

elementary school, but didn't really get close until high school. She helped me get my first job at 

American Eagle (hahaha), so I guess that technically made her one of my coworkers as well. 

We may not have been the best influences on each other during our Lake Braddock days 

(hehe), but we somehow made it out okay ;) Even though I only see Sophie a couple times a 

year, it's so easy to catch up with her! I can definitely count on Sophie to relate to the things that 

I'm going through and to put things into perspective.

                  Kathy currently works as a marketing manager and was my roommate throughout all four years 

of college. After kindling our friendship from our ninth-grade history class, we decided to 

become roommates at UVA! She was my "safety blanket" my first year at school, and we tried 

everything together. With that being said, Kathy is probably the one person who has the most 

embarrassing stories about me :P I love Kathy because she is super chill and always down for 

anything. I will always cherish our countless memories together - waiting for her dad after school 

every day in high school, to combining our beds and watching movies in college, to becoming 

grown-ups now, I will always consider her a life-long friend!

                  <div class="party-subtext">Sara Park</div>
                  Sara is an attorney at a big law firm in Manhattan! She and I met in middle school, and have

been close friends ever since! We would always have sleepovers at her house (she is super 

hospitable), and I see her as someone who is independent, but also someone who is really 

good at taking care of others (like me!). Not only is Sara super smart, but she is hands down 

one of the most loyal and dependable friends I have. I love Sara because she is the type of 

friend who will do anything for you! When John and I got engaged, she even rented a car and 

blew off writing an important paper just so she could congratulate us in person :) I am so 

thankful for her!

                  Joe is 15 months younger and growing up together wouldn’t have been the same without him.  

We’ve shared rooms for ~20 years of our lives, played outside together, and performed together 

as an orchestra trio (along with my sister) for many years.  These are all memories I cherish, the 

times that we’ve shared, weathered and enjoyed along the way.  I’m glad to have him by my 

side to share yet another life moment, this monumental life occasion.  He has always been the 

more hard-working, adventurous, and better looking Bae.  Though he is my ‘little’ brother, there 

is nothing little about him.  Ladies, he’s taken.

                  Jae is someone I consider to be my mentor and friend that I met in my 4th semester at GMU in 

a ministry called Immanuel Christian Fellowship (ICF).  From the many small group meetings, 

sporting events, leadership meetings, and trips we’ve taken, he’s been an awesome role model 

and an even better friend.  He is a big contributor of molding me into the man I am today. I am 

thankful for his prayers for me and his willingness to hang out on a whim. As adulthood 

becomes busier, I’m glad to know that we can always reach out to each other when needed, but 

also free to play anytime, just like we did in college.  Ladies, he’s single.

                  Our friendship probably started not too long after this Servants Ultimate Frisbee Tournament at 

UVA in 2009.  This picture depicts an epic block by Eric right in front of his then girlfriend, now 

wife.  It’s what friends do for each other, but all kidding aside, this was an epic play on his part.  

Since then we’ve shared many summers, playing on the same frisbee team on a DC 

recreational league.  He is a great athlete, but also a great leader.  I’ve had the privilege of 

being a part of his many culinary adventures and glad to say he gets nothing but my highest 

remarks. A cooking enthusiast and a great athlete, ladies, he’s taken.

                  <div class="party-subtext">David Cheng</div>
                  Our friendship budded the summer of 2010 from the weekly metro rides we shared on our way 

to our frisbee games in DC.  All these trips helped me realize that although the reliability of 

WMATA (DC Metro System) was nothing to rave about, quite the opposite can be said about my 

friendship with David. I have gotten to know David as a very chill, down to earth guy that is a 

secret nerd at work.  His optimistic attitude towards everything is quite inspiring and contagious, 

ladies, he’s single.

                  Joe and I have been friends since our college days at GMU and have shared many memorable 

summer days at his house, aka ‘The Orphanage’.  His “open to one and all” motto is how his 

house has been coined, but it more so reflects his generosity and willingness to always host a 

good time.  I’m glad and appreciative of this as it was truly a second home to me.  In addition, 

he is a firm believer that ‘anyone can cook’ which has also allowed me to thoroughly enjoy his 

concoctions.  Joe is an avid basketball player and an even bigger shoe collector, ladies, he’s 

taken.

                  <div class="party-subtext">Drew Williams</div>
                  Though I’ve known Drew for a short time, he is a guy that knew what he wanted and is very

loyal to his friends.  I’m glad to be one of those people that he can trust, but also vice versa.  He 

was my go to friend when it was a nice day for us to go on motorcycle rides or to the golf range.  

Everybody likes a good deal, but nobody does more so than Drew, and this has been our 

common ground.  Drew is the hardest working guy I know and willing to go over and beyond for 

his friends if need be. Ladies, he’s taken.
