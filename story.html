                  <p>I've never been big on the idea of Valentine's Day. But I guess I should give it more credit because ever since the Valentine's Day of 2013, my life has changed :)

                  John and I officially met at Corner Bakery while having lunch with mutual friends. John was quiet the entire lunch (probably because he didn't know anyone too well), so I didn't really notice him. To that note, we didn't talk after that. One day, however, I was hanging out with one of my closest girlfriends, and she told me that she knew someone who had a Valentine's day gift for me! It was very random and unexpected, but I was able to convince her to tell me who the mystery guy was- it was John! He got me Godiva chocolates and a card for Valentine's Day, and had my friend deliver them to me. I still remember the card, and how forward John was! To be honest, I still wasn't super interested at that point, but agreed to get coffee with him. We had decided to get to know each other as friends first, but I had such a good time with him! Our conversation flowed so smoothly and I could tell that we had instant chemistry. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since that first meeting at Starbucks, John continually planned cute "dates"/hangouts with friends, including: going to a DC kite festival (and flying a huge kite!), eating at an authentic medieval dinner/watching a jousting match, going to the annual cherry blossom festival, picking apples, and so much more! John definitely has a gift of planning activities. I started to realize what a legitimately kind, thoughtful, and patient guy John is, and it didn't take me long to fall for him!

                    A few months after, we made it official in Old Town, Alexandria... the same place where he later asked me to be his wife! :')
