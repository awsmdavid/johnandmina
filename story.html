            <p>"Hey, John, you want to go eat?" My answer was yes, despite not knowing where we were going nor who we were going with.  I was on my way to eat with some Hoo's. This would be the first time that Mina and I would officially meet!
            </p>
            <p>
            I made my first move by sending her a large box of Godiva Chocolates with a cute note through a mutual friend.  I thought to add some mystery by not signing the card and only leaving my phone number... but the messenger caved and that's how I became her "secret" Valentine for 2013.  
            </p>
            <p>
            After that, we exchanged several texts and eventually met up for coffee.  That coffee date forever changed my life, as the one thing she was perfectly clear on was that she was only interested in dating if marriage was the end result.  I was not intimidated.  We carried on our conversation through various topics and parted ways that night. Her laughter was contagious and company was pleasant to which it built my confidence enough to be forward and pursue her. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Over the course of next few months, I planned many events and hangouts with friends.  It was easy to find things to do with someone that was always perky and energetic when we were together.  During our time, Mina was easy to talk to and always energetic in our conversations - we had chemistry.  But most of all, I found her positive attitude encouraging and most attractive.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a lucky man and she's a great catch.  I look forward to the days ahead together with her! Friends and Family, please support us in this next chapter of our lives!

          <p>I've never been big on the idea of Valentine's Day. But I guess I should give it more credit because ever since the Valentine's Day of 2013, my life has changed :)
          </p>
          <p>
          John and I officially met at Corner Bakery while having lunch with mutual friends. John was quiet the entire lunch (probably because he didn't know anyone too well), so I didn't really notice him. To that note, we didn't talk after that. One day, however, I was hanging out with one of my closest girlfriends, and she told me that she knew someone who had a Valentine's day gift for me! It was very random and unexpected, but I was able to convince her to tell me who the mystery guy was- it was John! He got me Godiva chocolates and a card for Valentine's Day, and had my friend deliver them to me. I still remember the card, and how forward John was! To be honest, I still wasn't super interested at that point, but agreed to get coffee with him. We had decided to get to know each other as friends first, but I had such a good time with him! Our conversation flowed so smoothly and I could tell that we had instant chemistry. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that first meeting at Starbucks, John continually planned cute "dates"/hangouts with friends, including: going to a DC kite festival (and flying a huge kite!), eating at an authentic medieval dinner/watching a jousting match, going to the annual cherry blossom festival, picking apples, and so much more! John definitely has a gift of planning activities. I started to realize what a legitimately kind, thoughtful, and patient guy John is, and it didn't take me long to fall for him! 
          </p>
          <p>
            A few months after, we made it official in Old Town, Alexandria... the same place where he later asked me to be his wife! :')
